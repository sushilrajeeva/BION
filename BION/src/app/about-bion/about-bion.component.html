            <p class="card-text">Our brand name 'BION' origin is Greek. Bion means "life" or "to revive". We are an organic skincare brand focusing on holistic wellness with exquisite herbs and concoctions used by ancient royals. Our minimal range and premium quality handcrafted products are designed to blend traditional ayurvedic formulations with green biochemistry. Active chemicals can sensitize but plant based actives don't. Its our conscious decision to put toxins on our skin or let nature do its magic.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Why Choose Bion Essentials?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Tiny amounts of chemicals can have a significant impact on our health and hormonal balance. Our skin absorbs 60% of what is applied to it and hence few chemicals when in contact travel directly to the bloodstream. Also, we accidentally ingest products through our mouths and inhale through our nostrils.</p>
